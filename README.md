# Density-based greedy algorithm #

Implementation of the density based greedy algorithm for generating higher strength covering arrays, as given in this [paper.](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2339/4ad86b80a373de6c0077a8be1acc1798fc0c.pdf)
Project under [Prof. Soumen Maity](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~soumen/), IISER Pune. 

### About the code ###

* Specifically for 3-way coverage of any k,v configuration.

### Instructions ###
```
git clone https://github.com/smittal6/greedy-covering.git
cd greedy-covering
octave
```
* Once Octave is running, in the command window run `clear all; gthree`.
* Variable 'cover' holds the covering array generated.

### To-do list ###

* Generalizing t-tuple generation
* Trying different greedy versions of the algorithm
