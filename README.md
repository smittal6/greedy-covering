# Density-based greedy algorithm #

Implementation of the density based greedy algorithm for generating higher strength covering arrays, as given in this [paper.](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2339/4ad86b80a373de6c0077a8be1acc1798fc0c.pdf)

### About the code ###

* Specifically for 3-way coverage of any k,v configuration.

### Instructions ###
*

### To-do list ###

* Generalizing t-tuple generation
* Trying different greedy versions of the algorithm
